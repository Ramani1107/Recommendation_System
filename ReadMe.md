# Python Recommendation System Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of recommendation systems using Python. Recommendation systems are widely used in applications like e-commerce, social media, and streaming services to provide personalized recommendations to users based on their preferences and behavior.

## Types of Recommendation Systems Implemented
1. **Content-Based Recommendation System:**
   - Utilizes item profiles based on features like genre, actors, or keywords to recommend similar items to users.
   - Implements TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for calculating item profiles.

2. **Collaborative Filtering:**
   - Recommends items based on user behavior and preferences.
   - Uses a user-item matrix to predict user preferences by finding similarities between users or items.

## Components of the Project
- **TF-IDF Vectorizer:** Computes TF-IDF scores to build item profiles for content-based recommendations.
- **User-Item Matrix:** Represents user preferences and interactions for collaborative filtering.
- **Recommendation Algorithms:** Includes algorithms to generate recommendations based on content similarity or collaborative filtering methods.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Measures system performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
